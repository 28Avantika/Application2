# 3. Usage
To run the application:
python app.py

# 4. Scheduling Tasks 
The application includes a scheduling mechanism within weather_scheduler.py. This file is used to automate the collection and processing of weather data at predefined intervals.

The default schedule can be modified in the code to suit your specific requirements. For example, you can adjust how frequently data is collected by altering the timing settings in the   weather_scheduler.py   script.

# 5.  Visualization
By default, the following visualizations are available:

Temperature trends over time
Precipitation levels
Wind speeds

python visualization.py

# 6. Templates
The templates/ directory contains HTML templates used for rendering web-based views of the application
